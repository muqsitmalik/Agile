# Scrum Development - Agile Model

## Waterfall Model

- Linear and Sequential Approach:
  - Development process is divided into distinct, non-overlapping phases.
  - Each phase has specific goals.
  - Once a phase is completed, the project moves to the next phase, with typically no going back.

- Well-suited Characteristics:
  - Well-suited for projects with well-established and unchanging requirements.
  - Suited for projects expected to progress predictably.

- Phases in Waterfall Model:
  - Requirement Gathering and Documentation > System Design > Implementation > Testing > Deliver/Deployment > Maintenance.

- Change Management:
  - Making changes in the Waterfall Model, especially in later stages, can be expensive and time-consuming.

## Disadvantages of Waterfall Model

1. **Rigidity and Inflexibility:**
   - Difficulty making changes once a phase is completed.

2. **Late Feedback from Users:**
   - Stakeholder feedback collected after full system development.
   - Issues may be discovered late in the project.

3. **Testing Phase Delay:**
   - Testing is delayed until most of the project is implemented.
   - Defects or issues may not be identified until the testing phase.
   - Late identification of problems may require going back to earlier phases for correction.

## Agile Development

Agile is a software development approach that emphasizes iterative and incremental development, adapting to changing requirements, and delivering small, functional pieces of software in short timeframes.

## Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding values and principles for Agile software development.

### Agile Manifesto Values:

1. **Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools:**
   - Emphasizes the importance of people and their interactions in the development process.

2. **Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation:**
   - Prioritizes functional software delivery over extensive documentation.

3. **Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation:**
   - Advocates for close collaboration with customers to understand and address their needs.

4. **Responding to Change over Following a Plan:**
   - Encourages adaptability and the ability to respond to changing requirements.

### Agile Manifesto Principles:

1. **_Satisfy the Customer_ through Early and Continuous Delivery of Valuable Software:**
   - Prioritize delivering valuable software to customers in small, incremental releases to gather feedback and meet evolving needs.

2. **_Welcome Changing Requirements_, Even Late in Development:**
   - Be open to changes in requirements, recognizing that requirements may change as the project progresses.

3. **_Deliver Working Software Frequently_, with a Preference for the Shortest Timescale:**
   - Aim for regular, incremental releases of working software to gather feedback and provide value.

4. **_Collaboration between Business People_ and Developers throughout the Project:**
   - Foster continuous collaboration between business stakeholders and development teams for shared understanding and alignment.

5. **_Build Projects around Motivated Individuals_, Give Them the Environment and Support They Need, and Trust Them to Get the Job Done:**
   - Empower and trust motivated individuals, providing the necessary support and environment.

6. **Use _Face-to-Face Communication_ Whenever Possible:**
   - Prioritize direct, face-to-face communication to enhance understanding and collaboration.

7. **_Working Software_ is the Primary Measure of Progress:**
   - Evaluate project progress based on the delivery of functional software, not just completion of tasks.

8. **Maintain a _Sustainable Pace_ of Work for the Developers:**
   - Avoid overloading team members and promote a sustainable pace to maintain quality and morale.

9. **Continuous _Attention to Technical Excellence and Good Design_ Enhances Agility:**
   - Emphasize the importance of technical excellence and good design to ensure flexibility and maintainability.

10. **_Simplicity_—the Art of Maximizing the Amount of Work Not Done—is Essential:**
    - Prioritize simplicity in design and implementation to reduce unnecessary complexity.

11. **_Self-Organizing_ Teams Encourage the Best Architectures, Designs, and Requirements to Emerge:**
    - Empower teams to self-organize, allowing the best solutions to emerge through collaboration.

12. **At Regular Intervals, _Reflect_ on How to Become More Effective, Then Tune and _Adjust_ the Behavior Accordingly:**
    - Regularly review and reflect on team performance to identify areas for improvement and implement changes.
