# Scrum Development - Agile Model

## Waterfall Model

- Linear and Sequential Approach:
  - Development process is divided into distinct, non-overlapping phases.
  - Each phase has specific goals.
  - Once a phase is completed, the project moves to the next phase, with typically no going back.

- Well-suited Characteristics:
  - Well-suited for projects with well-established and unchanging requirements.
  - Suited for projects expected to progress predictably.

- Phases in Waterfall Model:
  - Requirement Gathering and Documentation > System Design > Implementation > Testing > Deliver/Deployment > Maintenance.

- Change Management:
  - Making changes in the Waterfall Model, especially in later stages, can be expensive and time-consuming.

## Disadvantages of Waterfall Model

1. **Rigidity and Inflexibility:**
   - Difficulty making changes once a phase is completed.

2. **Late Feedback from Users:**
   - Stakeholder feedback collected after full system development.
   - Issues may be discovered late in the project.

3. **Testing Phase Delay:**
   - Testing is delayed until most of the project is implemented.
   - Defects or issues may not be identified until the testing phase.
   - Late identification of problems may require going back to earlier phases for correction.

## Agile Development

Agile is a software development approach that emphasizes iterative and incremental development, adapting to changing requirements, and delivering small, functional pieces of software in short timeframes.

## Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding values and principles for Agile software development.

### Agile Manifesto Values:

1. **Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools:**
   - Emphasizes the importance of people and their interactions in the development process.

2. **Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation:**
   - Prioritizes functional software delivery over extensive documentation.

3. **Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation:**
   - Advocates for close collaboration with customers to understand and address their needs.

4. **Responding to Change over Following a Plan:**
   - Encourages adaptability and the ability to respond to changing requirements.

### Agile Manifesto Principles:

1. **Satisfy the Customer through Early and Continuous Delivery of Valuable Software:**
   - Prioritize delivering valuable software to customers in small, incremental releases to gather feedback and meet evolving needs.

2. **Welcome Changing Requirements, Even Late in Development:**
   - Be open to changes in requirements, recognizing that requirements may change as the project progresses.

3. **Deliver Working Software Frequently, with a Preference for the Shortest Timescale:**
   - Aim for regular, incremental releases of working software to gather feedback and provide value.

4. **Collaboration between Business People and Developers throughout the Project:**
   - Foster continuous collaboration between business stakeholders and development teams for shared understanding and alignment.

5. **Build Projects around Motivated Individuals, Give Them the Environment and Support They Need, and Trust Them to Get the Job Done:**
   - Empower and trust motivated individuals, providing the necessary support and environment.

6. **Use Face-to-Face Communication Whenever Possible:**
   - Prioritize direct, face-to-face communication to enhance understanding and collaboration.

7. **Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress:**
   - Evaluate project progress based on the delivery of functional software, not just completion of tasks.

8. **Maintain a Sustainable Pace of Work for the Developers:**
   - Avoid overloading team members and promote a sustainable pace to maintain quality and morale.

9. **Continuous Attention to Technical Excellence and Good Design Enhances Agility:**
   - Emphasize the importance of technical excellence and good design to ensure flexibility and maintainability.

10. **Simplicity—the Art of Maximizing the Amount of Work Not Done—is Essential:**
    - Prioritize simplicity in design and implementation to reduce unnecessary complexity.

11. **Self-Organizing Teams Encourage the Best Architectures, Designs, and Requirements to Emerge:**
    - Empower teams to self-organize, allowing the best solutions to emerge through collaboration.

12. **At Regular Intervals, Reflect on How to Become More Effective, Then Tune and Adjust the Behavior Accordingly:**
    - Regularly review and reflect on team performance to identify areas for improvement and implement changes.

## Advantages of Agile

- **Increased Client-Team Interaction:**
  - Agile fosters a high level of interaction between the client and the project team throughout the development process.

- **Enhanced Transparency to Clients:**
  - Unlike the waterfall model where clients may not see project outcomes until completion, Agile provides transparency in every phase, keeping clients informed.

- **Flexibility for Changes and Refinement:**
  - Agile allows for continuous refinement and reprioritization of the product based on changing requirements and client feedback.

- **Project Breakdown into Smaller Units:**
  - Agile methodologies involve breaking the project into smaller units, facilitating high-quality development, testing, and collaboration.

## Agile Methodologies

1. **Extreme Programming (XP):**
   - XP is an Agile methodology emphasizing technical excellence and frequent releases.

2. **Kanban:**
   - Kanban is a visual management method for software development, focusing on continuous delivery and workflow optimization.

3. **Lean:**
   - Lean principles, derived from manufacturing, are applied to software development to minimize waste and maximize value.

4. **Scrum:**
   - Scrum is a widely used Agile framework that organizes work into time-boxed iterations called sprints, promoting collaboration and regular delivery.

5. **Crystal:**
   - Crystal encompasses a family of Agile methodologies with different variants, emphasizing adaptability based on project characteristics.

## Scrum: An Agile Framework

## Scrum Roles:

### Product Owner:
- Represents the customer and stakeholders.
- Defines and prioritizes the product backlog.

### Scrum Master:
- Facilitates the Scrum process.
- Removes obstacles and ensures the team follows Scrum practices.

### Development Team:
- Cross-functional and self-organizing group.
- Responsible for delivering increments of the product.

## Scrum Artifacts:

### Product Backlog:
- An ordered list of features, enhancements, and fixes.
- Prioritized by the Product Owner.

### Sprint Backlog:
- A subset of the product backlog for the current sprint.
- Committed to by the development team.

### Increment:
- The sum of all product backlog items completed during a sprint.
- Represents a potentially shippable product.

## Scrum Events:

### Sprint:
- A time-boxed iteration, typically 2-4 weeks.
- Produces a potentially shippable product increment.

### Sprint Planning:
- A meeting at the beginning of each sprint.
- Defines what can be delivered in the sprint and how it will be achieved.

### Daily Scrum:
- A brief, daily meeting (15 minutes).
- Each team member shares progress, plans, and challenges.

### Sprint Review:
- A meeting at the end of each sprint.
- The development team presents the completed work to stakeholders.

### Sprint Retrospective:
- A meeting at the end of each sprint.
- The team reflects on the sprint and identifies improvements.

## Scrum Framework:

Product Backlog > Sprint Planning > Sprint Backlog > Sprint (Daily Scrum) > Sprint Review > Increment

Sprint Review > Sprint Retrospective > Sprint Planning

## Scrum Board:

Scrum board is a visual tool used in Scrum to manage and track the progress of work during a sprint.
The Scrum board typically consists of three main columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done.
The board is a valuable tool during the Sprint Review, demonstrating the work completed during the sprint.
