# Scrum Development - Agile Model

## Waterfall Model

- Linear and Sequential Approach:
  - Development process is divided into distinct, non-overlapping phases.
  - Each phase has specific goals.
  - Once a phase is completed, the project moves to the next phase, with typically no going back.

- Well-suited Characteristics:
  - Well-suited for projects with well-established and unchanging requirements.
  - Suited for projects expected to progress predictably.

- Phases in Waterfall Model:
  - Requirement Gathering and Documentation > System Design > Implementation > Testing > Deliver/Deployment > Maintenance.

- Change Management:
  - Making changes in the Waterfall Model, especially in later stages, can be expensive and time-consuming.

## Disadvantages of Waterfall Model

1. **Rigidity and Inflexibility:**
   - Difficulty making changes once a phase is completed.

2. **Late Feedback from Users:**
   - Stakeholder feedback collected after full system development.
   - Issues may be discovered late in the project.

3. **Testing Phase Delay:**
   - Testing is delayed until most of the project is implemented.
   - Defects or issues may not be identified until the testing phase.
   - Late identification of problems may require going back to earlier phases for correction.

## Agile Development

Agile is a software development approach that emphasizes iterative and incremental development, adapting to changing requirements, and delivering small, functional pieces of software in short timeframes.

## Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding values and principles for Agile software development.

### Agile Manifesto Values:

1. **Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools:**
   - Emphasizes the importance of people and their interactions in the development process.

2. **Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation:**
   - Prioritizes functional software delivery over extensive documentation.

3. **Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation:**
   - Advocates for close collaboration with customers to understand and address their needs.

4. **Responding to Change over Following a Plan:**
   - Encourages adaptability and the ability to respond to changing requirements.
