# Scrum Development - Agile Model

## Waterfall Model

- Linear and Sequential Approach:
  - Development process is divided into distinct, non-overlapping phases.
  - Each phase has specific goals.
  - Once a phase is completed, the project moves to the next phase, with typically no going back.

- Well-suited Characteristics:
  - Well-suited for projects with well-established and unchanging requirements.
  - Suited for projects expected to progress predictably.

- Phases in Waterfall Model:
  - Requirement Gathering and Documentation > System Design > Implementation > Testing > Deliver/Deployment > Maintenance.

- Change Management:
  - Making changes in the Waterfall Model, especially in later stages, can be expensive and time-consuming.

## Disadvantages of Waterfall Model

1. **Rigidity and Inflexibility:**
   - Difficulty making changes once a phase is completed.

2. **Late Feedback from Users:**
   - Stakeholder feedback collected after full system development.
   - Issues may be discovered late in the project.

3. **Testing Phase Delay:**
   - Testing is delayed until most of the project is implemented.
   - Defects or issues may not be identified until the testing phase.
   - Late identification of problems may require going back to earlier phases for correction.
